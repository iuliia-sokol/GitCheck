# GitCheck

The GitCheck app is a little pet-project, that allows you to check you "GitHub-CV", including your joining data, amount of created repos, amount of followers, location and name (if provided).
Funny octo-avatars and Git-statuses will appear depending on your registration date.

Octopus design and animation was created by me, inspired by the GitHub official logo.
